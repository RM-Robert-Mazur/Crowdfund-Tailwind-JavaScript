# 📝 Crowdfund - Frontendmentor.io Challenge 📝

This project is based on the challenge from Frontendmentor.io. I have used Tailwind CSS in order to create fully responsive layout based on the requirements provided. Another big part of this small project is the usage of JavaScript which makes this website fully workable.

Project brief:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked
- Usage of LocalStorage to store rewards list, available rewards stock and current progress of the fundraise.

This project is not fully completed. The next stage will be to rewrite the JavaScript in more organised way.
